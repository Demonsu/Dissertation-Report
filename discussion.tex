\chapter{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Module System

Currently F2J only supports single file compilation, which means that I have to put all the codes in one file. It is hard to manage the project and reuse most of the codes.

\item Exceptions

F2J does not supports exceptions, so that I cannot use those Java functions that will throw exceptions, such as I/O libraries.

\item Type Inferences

F2J's type parameters must be applied explicitly, which makes the code looks too verbose and hard to read.

\item Macros

F2J does not support macros now, but it is useful sometimes. For example, when I was using \texttt{Thunk} in the library, I have to construct a \texttt{Thunk} explicitly, such as

\begin{lstlisting}
let singleton[A] (x : A) : PList[A] =
    Cons[A] x (\(__: Unit) -> (Nil[A]));
\end{lstlisting}

If F2J supports macros, the lambda function could be replaced by a more expressive macro.

\end{itemize}
