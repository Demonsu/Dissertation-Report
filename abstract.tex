Recently parsing combinators have drawn much attention in the parsing world, which are implemented as higher order functions in a functional programming language. As the programming language research group in The University of Hong Kong is developing a functional programming language called \textit{F2J}, a parser combinator library is a must that serves as a utility member as \textit{parsec} does in \textit{Haskell}. And in order to print out the parsed result, a pretty printer is also a necessity for the library. This report demonstrates what a parser combinator and a pretty printer are, and how a library for both of them are implemented in \textit{F2J}. It emphasises on the introduction of methodologies adopted like monadic, the implementation details with application examples and some efficiency considerations.
