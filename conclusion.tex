\chapter{Conclusion}
In this report, we have implemented a parser combinator and pretty printer library in F2J. For the parser combinator part, 

We will test the performance of F2J by comparing with other existing functional languages on JVM, such as Scala, Clojure and Groovy. Collect time and memory consuming on each test cases for measuring the general performance of F2J. This result will show the abilities of F2J comparing with other existing languages.

We will also achieve our main goal, to implement an efficient parser and pretty printer combinators library. Then we will use our library to parse several formatted documents, such as XML and JSON documents. By comparing with other parsers written in other functional languages, such as Haskell, Scala and OCaml, we could identify and evaluate the bottleneck of our library and try to optimize it. Parsing and pretty printing are reversed approach, so the optimization mechanism could be applied to both of them.
