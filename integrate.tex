\chapter{Integrate Parser with Pretty Printer}

After building the parser and pretty printer library, we tried to combine the parser and pretty printer together. The program will take a string as an input, and then pretty print it to the screen.

In this chapter, we will takes arithmetic expression, XML, Feather Weight Java and a subset of F2J as examples.

\section{Arithmetic Expression}

For arithmetic expression, we chose the following as test cases

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

The parser is defined in \ref{section:simple_arith_expr_parser}, and the pretty printer is defined in ....

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

Put the test cases into ..., run the program and we will see the output

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}
